K17 - Deeper into D3

d refers to data in an array, when you're trying to use it in a function, and have it run once for reach element

Why does this code have two parameters, but only use one
    d3.selectAll("p").style("color", function(d, i) {
      return i % 2 ? "#fff" : "#eee";
    });

no need to use loops in d3

    selection.node()
will return the element, allowing it to be displayed

if you chain, you can call multiple operations on a selection at once, because the return value of the operation is the selection
otherwise you need to set a variable equal to it first, and then call the methods

data join is the general pattern for creating, updating, or destroying elements to reflect new data

selection.data computes enter, update, and exit selections (gets the new data?)
selection.join applies default logic for each, appending entering elements and removing exiting elements (does stuff with the new data?)
selection.attr or selection.style changes properties of the selection

can get data from files with
    FileAttachment {name: [name]}

d3 has no type inferencing

in the dynamic example, what is x do in the function

if height is set to 200, why does it go above, what does it actually do
