1:
Clicking item brings up a pop-up that shows the name of the table item
Clicking border doesn't do anything
In the js, this refers back to either the mouse click or the item in the table
You can loop through the items in the table with a for loop

2:
All of them make calls to getElementsByTagName but only the table one requires you to look at the 0 element of the list, meaning the other ones only return one element
td is each element
tr is each row of elements
table is table

3:
only a true was added
true brings that event listener to the front
stopPropagation stops the event from triggering anything else

4:
uh oh, now they're all true
the order that they're attached does not matter, it goes from the root to the branches if they're all true
stopPropagation does its job again
